# Communication

-   Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7 Layer Model:
    1.  Physical
    2.  Data Link
    3.  Network
    4.  Transport
    5.  Session
    6.  Presentation
    7.  Application

-   Hypertext tranfer protocol (HTTP)   

-   Transmission control protocol (TCP)
    -   High reliability, less time critical
    -   Web servers, SMTP, FTP, SSH

-   User datagram protocol (UDP)
    -   Less reliable, but works well in real time
    -   Lowest latency
    -   Late data is worse than loss data

-   Remote procedure call (RPC)

-   Representational state transfer (REST)
    -   Identify resources (URI)
    -   Change with representations
    -   Self descriptive error
    -   HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State)
