# Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS translates a domain name to an IP address.

DNS services can route traffic through various methods,

-   Weighted round robin
    -   Prevent traffic from going to bad servers
    -   Balance
    -   A/B testing

-   Latency based
-   Geolocation based

-   DNS introduces a slight delay
