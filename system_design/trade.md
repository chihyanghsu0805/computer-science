# Trade Offs

## Performance v.s. Scalability

-   Peformance problem: system is slow for single user
-   Scalability problem: fast for single for slow for heavy

## Latency v.s. Throughput

-   Latency: time to produce results
-   Throughput: number of results per time

Maximal throughput with acceptable latency

## Availability v.s. Consistency
