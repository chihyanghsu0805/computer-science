# Data Structures

## Hash Table
Hash table use hash function to map keys to values to achieve efficient lookup, O(1).
Collisions happen when two keys have the same hash code.
There are severak ways to avoid collision,
- Chaining with Linked List or Binary Search Tree.
- Open Addressing with Linear Probing.

## Array List
Array list have dynamic size to overcome fixed array size in Java.
