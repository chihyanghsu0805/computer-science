# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort (Stable, In-place)
Bubble sort compares each pair and swap bigger one to back, O(N<sup>2</sup>).

## Selection Sort (Can be Stable, In-place)
Selection sort finds minimum and swap to corresponding index, O(N<sup>2</sup>).

## Merge Sort (Stable, In-place)
Merge sort divides the array then sort and merges, O(NlogN).

## Quick Sort (not Stable, In-place)
Quick sort picks a pivot and partitions the array into larger and smaller subarrays and sort them recursively, O(NlogN).

## Counting Sort (not In-place)
Counting sort counts the values and sort them.

## Radix Sort (not In-place)
Radix sort start with the most signficane digit and sorts each bucket.
