## Graph
- BFS: Graph traversal and vist siblings first. Good for finding shortest path. O(V+E)
- DFS: Graph traversal and visit children first. Good for puzzles and games. O(V+E)
- Dijkstra: Finding shortest path (with distance) between nodes, does not work on negativ weights. O(V<sup>2</sup>), with binary heap O(ElogV)
- FloydWarshall: Finding shortest path (with distance) between all nodes. O(V<sup>3</sup>)
